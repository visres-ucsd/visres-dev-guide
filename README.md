# Shiley Eye Institute - Development Guide

The purpose of this repository is to document best practices that individuals and teams should undertake when writing code in the Shiley Eye Institute environment.

## Overview of best practices

The following checklist should be considered for all eye institute members involved in coding:

- Put consdieration on how to [writing good code](#writing-good-code)
- Code being used in publications should undergo [code review](#code-review).
- Use [version control](#version-control)

## Details

### Writing good code

'Writing good code' is a large topic, and what to learn next about it varies with current skill level. As such, the advice here is just to *put in effort* to make your code clean and understandable.

For those less familiar with how to do this, check out [these tips](/guides/high-yield-code-quality-advice.MD). For more experienced developers in the team, please reference the [style guide](/guides/general-style-guide.MD) for improving internal consistency.

### Code review

Code review is when someone else looks through your code. This has many benefits, namely:

- **Improving code quality**: reviewer can pick up errors, and improve convoluted code that's more likely to cause errors.
- **Learning**: reviews allow us to share knowledge and skills that can improve everyone's work.
- **Easier collaboration**: reviews allow us to gain familiarity with the work of colleagues, making it easier to subsequently collaborate on projects.

In addition, the knowledge that someone will review your code may have the tendency to make you write better, more readable code in the first place!

### Version control

Version control software allows us to keep a history of changes for a set of files, and perform related actions such as compare versions. More information can be found [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/version-control-systems/).

Code for specific studies within the Shiley Eye Institute should have its own repository, as should reused code. However, careful attention should be paid to security - please read [the following guide]

## Contributing

This is an ongoing effort. Anyone involved, or beginning to get involved, with coding in the Shiley Eye Institute should feel welcome to contribute.

Questions or suggestions should be made through the issues tab in this GitHub repo. To contribute a change, please submit a pull request.
