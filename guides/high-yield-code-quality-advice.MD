# High yield pointers for good quality code

Writing good quality code is a skill that continually grows as you become more experienced in programming. For these interested in investing more time into this, a widely-recommended book is 'Clean Code'[link](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882).

However, here are some of the 'big hitters' to improve the quality of your code.

* **Use sensible names**:
    - Naming functions and variables in a meaningful way will make your code more readable and reduce cognitive load.
* **Avoid repetition**:
    - If you're often rewriting / copy-and-pasting code that does the same thing, consider turning it into a function that you can reuse. This will save time, improve reliability and readability.
* **Include comments**:
    - This will help you more quickly understand what a function does.
* **Keep it simple**:
    - You're less likely to make errors if your implementation is straightforward.

Remember, we typically spend significantly more time reading than typing, so making code more readable has a good chance of improving your productivity!
